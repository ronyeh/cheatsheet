#Android Studio
* When building projects with NDK on OS X, it's possible that `ndk.dir` is `null`.

  * Edit local.properties to add `ndk.dir=/Users/{username}/Library/Android/ndk`. 
  Yes, this file is automatically generated by Android Studio and you aren't supposed to edit it.
  But this works!
  
  * Go to `Preferences > Appearances & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK > SDK Tools` and 
  check the box next to Android NDK.

    * Once downloaded, the NDK will be located at `/Users/{username}/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle`
    * If Android Studio doesn't automatically configure ndk.dir, you can directly edit local.properties
    to add `ndk.dir=/Users/{username}/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle`.
