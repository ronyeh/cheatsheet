* When building projects with NDK on OS X, it's possible that `ndk.dir` is `null`.

  * Edit local.properties to add `ndk.dir=/Users/{username}/Library/Android/ndk`. 
  Yes, this file is automatically generated by Android Studio and you aren't supposed to edit it.
  But this works!
  
  * Alternatively, go to `Preferences > Appearances & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK > SDK Tools` and 
  check the box next to Android NDK.
